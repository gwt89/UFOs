# UFOs
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to design a webpage that allows users to filter UFO sightings for multiple criteria at the same time. Users will be able to filter the UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape.

You can use the Filter Search to narrow down your search results. To run a search simply enter an item into the corresponding search field and press Enter or Return on your keyboard. To reset the search you can either reload the page or click on UFO Sightings in the top left of the page.

Here is a visual example of searching by a Date.

### Summary
* One drawback of the webpage is that in order to get a result by using the Filter Search you have to enter in a result that is in the data; otherwise you will simply get no results. 
* One recommendation I have is to design the Filter Search differently so that it provides results even though there might not be an exact match. For example if you were to enter in 1/10/2010 for the Date sacramento for the City and ca for the State you will get no results. This is because the only UFO sighting that occurred in Sacramento was on 1/2/2010. I think it would be helpful to still have that result show up even though it's not an exact match. Additionally you could add a message to the results saying "no exact match found" that way the person knows they are simply viewing all similar data.
* Another recommendation I have would be to add more information to the data so when the search results come up they can help link you to additional information. In some cases of UFO sightings there have been pictures taken, videos recorded, or newspaper stories written. If such information is available I think having links in the results would be useful.
